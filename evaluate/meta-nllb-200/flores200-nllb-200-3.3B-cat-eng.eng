USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and recognizes the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the United States Olympic Committee's statement that the interest of athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by significant advances in organization, rather than by removing certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could clarify how an abuse, of the proportions so courageously described by Larry Nassar's survivors, could have gone unnoticed for so long, and adopt the necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, and other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowered environment.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but it also offers details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plume of this animal was brownish brown on the top with a light or carotenoid background.
The find also offers insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed barrel, called a tail, but do have other features of feathers - beards and barbs - researchers infer that the tail was probably a more recent evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen features the plumage of an adult and not a chick.
The researchers suggest that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, not feathery plumage.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 people yesterday morning.

They found that the Sun operated under the same basic principles as other stars: it was found that the activity of all the stars in the system depended on their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done has been mostly theoretical, but the program has been written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the earth, which causes tides, the Milky Way exerts an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many tiny particles.
Some television reports show white smoke billowing from the plant.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered the Extremely Drug Resistant TB (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the high fatality rate".
Some patients may have picked up the bacteria in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health workers.
An infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts over a year.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the whole group of people with TB still seems to be low; 6,000 people out of a total of 330,000 infected at any given time in South Africa.

Infrared images show day and night temperature variations that show that they are probably caves.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day, and hotter at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the hypothesis that they are deep clots in the ground, said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a not-so-technological experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put in an envelope a pre-printed piece of paper with the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
French electoral law strictly codifies the procedures.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can be witnesses that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added to them other than those of the voters duly counted and authorized. 
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under close supervision, following specific procedures.

The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to Great Yarmouth's James Paget Hospital.
He was reassigned to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Sheriff's Court of Scotland charged with the murder of her son.
He's in custody pending arraignment and trial, but any visual evidence could be dismissed because his image has been posted everywhere.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects".
The Crown Office, the prosecutor, has indicated to reporters that they will not be making any further statements, at least until the sentencing.
The document, according to the leak, will reference the border dispute, which Palestine wants to settle according to the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other issues reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley dispute.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA only commits to accepting it for five years.
The hunters in the supplementary pest control pilot trial had to be closely supervised by the forest rangers, as the pilot trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated. 
In a partnership of NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Park Conservation and Heritage Interim Director with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received proper safety training and training.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It's the fifth Provisional Electoral Council in Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections. 
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which were scheduled for 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPod malfunctions and overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents related to overheating, which the company called "not serious".
In response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report an "unfortunate misstep".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office has said there have been no reports of damage in the nation.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that there had been no tsunami warning.
A former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage to hijack his bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, as well as the Filipino photographers, have recently been released.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' of flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow fighters have also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna died on the night of the two moons, quite unique, just like her, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels has commented that "Luna was as freaky as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and will meet her at the altar...I hope she finds herself in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those polled want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic sooner rather than later, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question due to his complaints.
He has not been able to take the medication necessary to endure his pain because it is forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number discovered as of January 25.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water sent to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since some comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and shenanigans".
He is speculated to be running for president in the 2016 election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the old ground-based radar technology so that traffic controllers can locate pilots much more accurately and send them more accurate information.
There is no provision for increased transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley; there are also no car parks or connecting car parks on the street.
Concerns about a lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the match will be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that much longer was needed for this process, due to crossbreeding between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes (endemic), and a Galápagos finch of conical beak, Geospiza contrisiros (foreign).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be molded into smaller figures.
It can be inserted into thin wires, which can be twisted. It can be struck or flattened into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stacked on other metals, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images of books called "illustrated manuscripts".
And this is called the pH of a substance, and you can make an indicator out of the juice of the Lombardic cabbage.
Lombard cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the pH H) in the substance being analyzed.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with wet, clean hands, make a ball.
The moisture from the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewers have been discovered in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Baths were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, they were part of public bathhouses where men and women would gather in a joint company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back to us, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and our vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way, and the most remarkable thing that the wheel has done for us is make transportation much faster and easier.
We have been transported by train, by car, and by many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including feral domestic cats) that eat the small prey that are far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special job that each cat has that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats and live in large groups called packs.
The herds are made up of one to three related adult males along with up to thirty females and pups.
Females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave much like cubs or wolf packs, which are animals with a behavior surprisingly similar to that of lions (although not that of other large felines) and equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and push with 5 times the force of a forced human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's full-voiced roar, but rather like a phrase shouted from the words of a naive.
The bird likes to eat small animals, and if he can, he will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals he hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists believe that the birds follow and find the animals that they eat (prey) by smell, summing up the tracks they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. The birds hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with the environment and then leaping over their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main and original group (for example, by crossing a mountain range or a river, or they migrate to a new island and cannot go back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they had before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed a bit, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our homes with plants and we make clothes with plants, and most of what we eat is plants, and without plants, most animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, which is why it was afraid of nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Their long jaws had over seventy sharp teeth like knives, accompanied by an additional set of teeth in the roof of the mouth, so that there was no escape route for anything that got in their way.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, his diet included turtles, long-finned fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could rival it.
While most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans had a few rare or unusual items at their banquets; such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and rodents called lyreons.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on a chair, rich men liked to participate in banquets where they would get all wet together while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that had come to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
So for example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a closed sanctuary that only the chaplains could access.
Sometimes special tower-shaped pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simply open counters facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the timber was extremely expensive.
Norse sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland because of a murder and, traveling west, discovered Greenland and named it.
Now, despite its discovery, there were already Inuit tribes living there at that time.
Although all were "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that on the back of the Declaration of Independence, there's a treasure map written.
Now, that's not true. Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is found at the bottom of the document, downward.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its creation the long parchment (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it looks like the notation was just added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by Vichy France, which was Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were advancing on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this also defines in some ways the dimensions of society.
Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a persistent cultural footprint and an equitable distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any obvious historical traces and are not recognized as civilizations proper.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - Congress being its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and, as there was no national executive or judicial, it fell to the state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did he have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
The most well-known sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and F1 motor racing.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, and have the presence of Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, we often call it, in geographical terms, an "archipelago".
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, where it began transforming indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese workers for rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common frame format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size at the close of the analogue film era.
It still occurs today, but even more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited in the sensor formats of digital image cameras.
The 35mm format actually creates a bit of confusion, with 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been overused and often ridiculed, is a simple rule that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
He says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection between the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was challenged.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united the European states despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds exist precisely for this reason.
The church's main authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this dogma was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, though this blockade violated generally accepted international laws that had been codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire segments of ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at the last job he had) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different historical eras: each stage of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable period of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars were fought between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods of ancient China, thousands of people died fighting for the top seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Likewise after the Revolution, occupations were opened up to all men who applied for them allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This applies to the military as well, because instead of basing the army's ranks on classes, from this point on they were based on relevance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad took a deep interest in matters that transcend this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that would come to be known as "Hira" on the Mount of "Noor" (Light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even knowing it exists, it's not easy to find.
There is nothing to see but a serene and beautiful sky above your head, and the abundant mountains that surround it.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Death Valley contains several pyramids (of which, the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "upward bow" sign resembles the letter V (downward bow) and the "downward bow" looks like a cluster or a square without the bottom side.
When it's upside down, it means you start at the tip and push the bow upwards, and when it's downside down, it means you start at the heel (which is where the hand holds the bow) and stretch the bow downwards.
Rubbing the strings from right to left produces a softer sound, while rubbing them backwards produces a louder, more assertive sound.
Feel free to write down your own indications, but bear in mind that the bow marks are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a crowd of women merchants to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and babbling threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to carry the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, a member of the crowd showed the head of a royal guard murdered at Versailles to the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, to cover much of the cost and interest of the bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the huge profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that promoted the creation of the order.
The time when the events took place is popularly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1,000 - 1,300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological impetus or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is guided by an occult logic that is associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, you could say that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network for a handful of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical care techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had an important component of cultural determinism, drawn by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged that were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, as they were in harmony with the place and with society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders had returned bringing gifts such as chairs and spices that were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital left Constantinople for Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak of popularity in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, styles could reach the West 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the major developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to button clothes.
Subsistence farming is the practice of producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family alone.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses native stored seeds of the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel abandoned by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ due to the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as different may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture are often distinguished from other subcultures by the distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up, due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse.
Some wild children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical deficiency by the parents.
Wild children may have suffered childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild all alone.
The feral child, when raised solely by nonhuman animals, exhibits behaviors (always within certain physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the animal that raises it, such as fear or indifference in relation to humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the framework goes one step further.
The bastion theory is not a learning method but a tool that provides support to individuals undergoing a new training experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a project.
The bastions can be virtual or real: in other words, a teacher is a form of bastion, but so is the little Microsoft Office assistant clip.
Virtual bastions are embedded in software and are designed to question, demonstrate and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
Children are put into foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse to extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where they're not fed, loved and educated, but some do.
We believe that the foster care system is a form of security for these children.
Our host system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The host is supposed to confer all the needs that were not covered in the house from which they were originally taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet bring additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated the public's reaction to websites. 
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it can be detected whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that these interpretative abilities of human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of variation that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine the variation back and forth between the two genetic heritages in each generation.
In the savannah, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet their amino acid needs with available plant resources.
And failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to get would have been the proteins that we get from the leaves and the vegetables, but unless they're cooked, these are hard for primates like us humans to digest.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
However, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a while (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easy to do using a low-noise alarm clock that makes you aware but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you are one of those who resets your watch while you sleep, try putting it on the other side of the room, so that you have to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is correlated in an opposite way to the amount of tension in one's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is present.
The only thing that stands in the way of enlightenment is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were spread by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini Yoga is the awakening of kundalini energy (enlightened energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga, through visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which facilitated the collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice came the clash of systems, processes and cultures, and both countries became enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years and was fought in earnest, with delegated armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939 the Polish defences had already been penetrated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union entered and created the fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral or multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient method of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to make sure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans were trying to move men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it's likely that Germany could have conquered Britain, just as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hillsides or other grazing areas, often watched over by shepherds who were usually children or teenagers.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they were used by horse-drawn wagons to achieve higher speeds and to carry larger loads in the most difficult parts.
The crossbars were introduced early on to hold the rails in place, but it was soon seen that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron cover over them.
This became a common practice, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the wagons the most.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright in the usual way.
Two-legged specialisations have been found in austrolyte fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropes may have walked on two legs at all stretches 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering that might exist in the future.
This works only as a symptomatic treatment in most cases, however, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and we should disable them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and that problems have been increased by overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyles.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap Flyers".
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pamphlets that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and that the cat is alive. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many features of birds that resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaur would.
Virtually all the computers we use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, depending on computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look for first aid instructions for the specific poison on the label.
The term insect is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient relative of the cricket, which is an insect highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both redwoods and grasshoppers are nest-builders, adapted to see in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of MS, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has concluded that women are twice as likely to suffer from MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which in fact guides most of the scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greeks declined, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments marking the virus' DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the virus' protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of in situ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information. 
One example is to visit, photograph and learn about the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from small rural villages to their workplace and pass by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic vehicle, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science today shows us that this enormous coal economy has triggered one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported human evolution for the last two billion years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate these kinds of complaints, why do they fail every day? Is it that transportation engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a considerably constant range; therefore, the flow of traffic tends to have considerable constancy and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) throughput, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air, and their ability to fly helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their body.
This provides them with a variety of tiny places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the spider monkey and the ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
There were people who thought what he said was true, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system moved towards the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because we don't have the sense that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 4,000 miles long and draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people living in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
There is knowledge of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as they can all be discovered in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although they also, according to his theory, changed to become new substances that form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of atoms would fit inside the endpoint of this sentence.
So the pencil became a good friend to a lot of people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a status and a few minor uses.
Nowadays, you can write messages on computer screens without ever needing a sharpening machine.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to join a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up a hill, separating the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break up with little or no collision.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The bark is 70 km thick at its nearest point and 100 km at its farthest point.
It's thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
There may be more lunar seas on the visible side because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to come up to the surface.
Content theories are about finding out what people like or are interested in.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized so that they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can appear as managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to continue as "just another guy" (or girl).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary action, conducting assessments, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable for their actions.
In the opposite case, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that you have to change everything that the team has been doing and make it your own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often ends in bickering between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual computers are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional computers, but with some small differences.
Members of a virtual group often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each member addresses. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can flourish when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
Consequently, an organization's joint work to overcome adversity can lead to an innovative process to respond to customer need.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, so it narrows down the area of research and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, it forms a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been built into various home computer applications and video games.
Theme excursions are an important part of any classroom, and very often, a teacher would love to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or contemplate the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with prospective students.
For example, every year the students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online as a memoir.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills, and although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, this often changes with the existence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to make an effort to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogs "force students to be more astute with the world around them". The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; they can define their own positions in the context of what others are writing about and also highlight their own perspectives on specific issues by actively responding to internet materials (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls and to the north are the pristine natural beauties of Muskoka and beyond.
It is all of these elements, among others, that make Ontario stand out in the eyes of outsiders as the Canadian city of excellence.
The population of the great northern expanses is rather sparse, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To make a comparison of populations that is often surprising, there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest by far, and a continent in itself as far as wildlife is concerned.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and made a great way to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape of Good Hope in India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler state that she is married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (one that does not look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be chased, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Reject men firmly, and don't be afraid to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, it's not OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazonian fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used as a strategic port by Phoenicians, Romans, and Benimerans, who named it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city with the name of Daru l-Badya, the name of Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as Tajins, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it's all designed for tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, towards the eastern end, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is considerably safe, it is worth investigating before making any visits outside of this city to assess the state of the fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most economical mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' special program "Wonders of the African World" for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has an Arab air rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River marking the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each one witnessing diverse wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the benchmark of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, a daily conservation and entry fee is payable.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a selection of South African parks, or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main center.
The set of buildings that make up the urban silhouette of Hong Kong has been related to a bright bar chart that is made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the other side of the Kowloon boardwalk.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely populated on land gained from the sea along the north coast.
This is the site that British settlers occupied, so it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and the area is now estimated to have 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 tiger eels.
Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get around to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Panakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two 3.50 metres wide lanes.
The vertical open space under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft) wide. Although construction was completed in August 2011, it was not possible to cross the bridge until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazil's customs are expected to be cleared.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important annual tournament of this sport takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
There are also smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments or where to buy tickets for the polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), with a value set equivalent to that of one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
Credit cards are probably not accepted on the outlying islands, although they may accept British and US currency; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so you have to do it on the go.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make the feeling colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is more or less constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bones and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from other wildlife!
As docile as they may seem, bison, raccoon, ant, bone and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping enough distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them your space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bones and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous insubordination in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Beaches are plentiful, as Auckland is flanked by two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most of them have shade thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches on Tamaki Drive are in Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive Mission Bay and St Heliers neighbourhoods in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes family-friendly beaches with a good range of shops along the coast.
The best known local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have a lot of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines just don't tolerate travel very well.
It's perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but if you're afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of carving is foreign. A short coffee is an espresso, the cappuccino comes well loaded with cream (no foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The chocolate chip is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but the quality is excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
However, he follows the recommendations of the authorities, he respects all the signs and pays close attention to the safety warnings.
Cubozoos are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and shy away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not live an active life in the ocean; their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to present other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any requests or suggestions should be sent to the travel agency first and not to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp out there, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll want to get there early enough to get a place to camp near the music.
It is important to remember that even if the music has stopped on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin's location, because crossing the ice makes a terrible noise in the hardest hit areas.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include a time in the city. Passenger cruises are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos often strive to maximize the time and money their visitors spend there. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment offers to cheer the guests up and keep them from leaving the establishment.
Some venues offer alcohol in the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or through mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice or very low temperatures.
Friction is low on icy, snowy roads, and you can't drive on them like you would on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to get you trapped in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling snow or being displaced by wind, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without many interruptions throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the most important tourist attraction in Africa and the most relevant for many tourists.
The term safari in popular usage refers to the journey over land to see the fantastic African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants or giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for good views.
Animals like lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and that's why you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "country walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") is a form of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March most coronavirus cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were due to be held.
Most tickets to the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a typical ticket for around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have an ironing board and iron, even if there is none in the room.
If an iron is not available or if you do not like to wear your socks ironing, then you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (it could shrink or, in extreme cases, bump).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough; in others, it takes several minutes.
Efficiency varies from filter to filter, and if you have concerns you should consider buying water from a well-known brand in sealed bottles.
Travellers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to them in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or animals capable of forcibly injuring or killing people, are not normally considered pests.
Duty free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods free of taxes and duties in certain places.
Travellers bound to countries with high taxation can sometimes save themselves a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, which frequently passes through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: steep slopes, narrow sections and tight curves are common.
The speed limits indicated are notably lower than those of other front and rear sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict obedience to the limits is even more important than if it were otherwise.
Although it's curious, cell phone service is more powerful here than in many other segments of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good and Bavarian pastry is very, very diverse, similar to that of Austria, its southern neighbors.
Fruit pastas are common, with apples cooked inside the pastas all year round and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also carry almonds, hazelnuts and other dried fruits. The best-known pastries often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but tasty pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is in common use.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a catch-all term to cover a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without any other qualifier, the term usually means the food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Today, Javanese cuisine is easy to find all over the archipelago and offers a wide variety of dishes spiced simply. The favorite flavors of Javanese people are usually cocoa beans, beans, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The steppes are supports for the rider's feet that hang from either side of the saddle.
They're more stable for the jettison, but they can present safety issues because the jettison's feet could get caught in them.
If a jockey jumps off the horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse runs away.

Alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered slopes down the coast with skis or a surfboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums", planning entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The concept of skiing is very old - there are cave paintings symbolizing skiers from before 5000 BC!

In good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than walking - although you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a beige backpack on flat tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling between different countries would involve many visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions as one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means that you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen countries separately, saving time, money and paperwork.

Horseshoe currents are the flow that returns after the waves have hit the beach, often at a reef or similar.
Because of the topology of the water, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper stations, and a strong current can form towards deep water.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue from trying to swim backwards against the current, which can be impossible.
So good point of departure of the stream, swimming backwards is no more difficult than usual.

Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it's also quite special (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises make an extended stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic city centre using a couple of full days by returning to sleep on the night boat.
If you only land with excursions on board, you do not need an independent visa (dated 2009).

On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem with other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent the stuff by air, there are routes where unloading it and going through customs can take days.
The only way to get it through faster was to do it as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger to carry it, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a good chunk of money for that privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
Now, this is not cheap: you can normally expect to pay up to four times the economy fare for business class, and up to eleven times for first class!
In general, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
