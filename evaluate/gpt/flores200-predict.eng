"Edgar Veguilla was injured in one arm and the jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider needed reconstructive surgery for his face."
"Uka's weapon failed as he aimed towards the head of the fifth man. Schneider constantly suffers, he is blind in one eye, missing a part of his skull, and has a reconstructed titanium face."
"Schneider declared via videoconference from a United States Air Force base in his country."
"Beyond Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in 2 individual races at the Championship."
"The first one was the slalom, in which he got a "Did not finish" on the first run. Thirty-six of the remaining 116 competitors finished with the same result."
"The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth position among the seated women's group, with a combined time of all the laps of 4:41.30; 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first to finish, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary."
"Four female skiers from the seated group did not finish their races, and 45 out of a total of 117 giant slalom skiers did not manage to qualify in the race."
"The stolen laptop and mobile phone were recovered thanks to the work of the Madhya Pradesh police."

"He was relocated to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge."
"Since then, Adekoya has been at the Sheriff Court in Scotland charged with the murder of her son."
"It is under custody pending accusation and trial, but any visual testimony could be rejected because their image has been published everywhere."
"This is a common practice in any other place in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially harmful."
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects".
"The Crown's office, responsible for the accusations, has informed journalists that it will not make any further statements, at least until the verdict."
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to establish based on the borders before the Middle East War of 1967.
Among the other issues discussed, as it appears, are the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the dispute over the Jordan Valley.
"Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA only commits to accepting it for five years."
"The hunters in the supplementary pest control pilot test had to be closely supervised by forest rangers, as the pilot test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated."
"In an association of NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association."
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Interim Director of the Conservation and Heritage Park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received appropriate safety training and preparation.
"Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members."
"It is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martelly in four years."
"Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections."
"The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October."
"The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of holding elections, some of which were scheduled for 2011."
"Nearly 60 cases of malfunction and overheating of iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people."
"The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has declared that it had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices."

Likewise, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that there had been no tsunami warning.
An ex-Filipino police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage to hijack their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
"Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists."
"Many hostages have been rescued and so far the death of at least six has been confirmed."
Recently, six hostages were released, including children and elderly people, as well as Filipino photographers.
"Afterwards, the photographers took the place of an old lady who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot and killed."
"Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine."
"She trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959."

Dustin "Goldust" Runnels has commented that "Luna was as freaky as me...maybe even more...I love her and I will find her at the altar...I hope she is in a better place."
"Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic grew by 8% since 2008."
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
"34% of those surveyed want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia."
"At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic."
"The winner of the gold medal at the Olympic Games had to swim in the 100 and 200-meter freestyle events and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been called into question due to his complaints."

"Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number discovered as of January 25th."
"Many people verified the discovery using different machinery and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday."
"Comets could have been a source of water sent to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life."
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed, since some comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
"Cuomo, 53 years old, began his government earlier this year and signed a law last month to legalize same-sex marriage."
"He dismissed the rumors as 'political chatter and nonsense'."
"It is speculated that he/she will run for the presidential elections in 2016."
"NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions."
"They use satellite-based technology instead of the old technology based on ground radars so that air traffic controllers can locate pilots with much more precision and send them more accurate information."
"The reinforcement of transportation is not considered and surface trains will not stop at Wembley; there are also no car parking or shuttle parking facilities on the street level."
"The concern about a lack of transportation has led to the possibility that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team."
"A study published on Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian islands of Galápagos."
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, despite the fact that it was thought to take much longer for this process, due to the crossing between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis (endemic), and a Galapagos finch with a conical beak, Geospiza conirostris (foreign).
"Gold can be worked in all kinds of ways. It can be molded into the smallest of figures."
"It can be inserted into thin threads, which can be twisted. It can be hit or flattened into sheets."
"It can be made very thin and stacked on top of other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts"."
"This is called the pH of a substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice."
"The color of red cabbage juice changes depending on whether a substance is acidic or basic (alkaline)."
"The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the analyzed substance."
"The hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron)."
"Mix the two dry powders and then, with clean wet hands, make a ball out of it."
"The moisture of the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of barrier."
"The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated system of wastewater."
"Remains of sewage systems have been discovered in houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece."
"There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women gathered together."
"When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite."
"The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously."
"The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and our vision."
"A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space."
"The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most notable thing that the wheel has done for us is to make transportation much faster and simpler."
"The train, the car, and many other means of transportation have brought us here."
"Below them there are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer."
Finally, there are many small felines (including feral domestic cats) that eat the small prey that are far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
"The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat has and that prevents them from competing with others."
"Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides."
"The herds are formed by one to three adult males related together with up to thirty females and puppies."
"Females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters."
"Lion prides behave to a great extent like packs of dogs or wolf packs, which are animals with surprisingly similar behavior to lions (although not to other large felines) and equally deadly to their prey."
"The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (although not very well), swim, jump great distances, and push with 5 times the strength of a strong human."
"The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar."
"The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather more like a shouted phrase of angry words."
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find the animals they eat (prey) using their sense of smell, sniffing the trails they leave on the ground.
"They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with the environment and then pouncing on their prey."
"When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main and original group (for example, by crossing a mountain range or a river, or by emigrating to a new island and not being able to go back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they had before."
"This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it needed before to be a strong competitor."
"The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before."
"With time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less."
"Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species."
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
"Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, that we breathe out)."
"Plants manufacture their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade."
"We build our houses with plants and make clothes with plants. Most of what we eat are plants. Without plants, most animals could not survive."
"The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, which is why it was not afraid of anything, except for other mosasaurs."
"Their long jaws had more than seventy teeth sharpened like knives, accompanied by an additional set in the roof of their mouth, so there was no escape for anything that stood in their way."
"We don't know for sure, but it may have had a bifurcated tongue. Its diet included turtles, long fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal."
"He also attacked everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could rival him."
Although most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans had a few rare or unusual products at their banquets, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and some rodents called dormice.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate sitting in a chair, rich men liked to participate in banquets where they could feast together while eating.
"The ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that have arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries."
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
"The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god."
"People offered sacrifices to the gods and the chaplains tried to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals."
"Each temple had an open courtyard and then a closed sanctuary to which only the chaplains could access."
"Sometimes special pyramids in the form of towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples."
"The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods."
"In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing was not as important."
"The majority of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors."
"The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters that faced the street. Stone was used to build houses."
"There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive."
"Greenland was sparsely populated. Nordic sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland due to a murder and, while traveling west, discovered Greenland and gave it its name."
However, despite their discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although all were "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
"If you have seen the movie National Treasure, perhaps you imagine that behind the Declaration of Independence there is a treasure map written."
However, this is not true. Although there is something written behind the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text is located at the bottom of the document, facing downwards.
Although nobody knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its creation the long parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, it seems that the notation was simply added as a label.
"The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free."
"It was governed by the "Vichy" France. These were French people who had signed peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of confronting them."
"The Allies invaded the south of France on August 15, 1940, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon"."
"In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were advancing towards Germany."
"A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together, a society."
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, with the meaning of city or city-state, and this also defines in some way the dimensions of society.
City-states preceded nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and equitable dissemination.
"Minority cultures often disappear without leaving clear historical traces and are not recognized as proper civilizations."
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with the Congress being its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
"The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it fell upon the state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all their acts."
"Nor did he have the authority to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states."
"The Articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often absented themselves."
"The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the champions of the FIFA World Cup 2006."
"The most well-known sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing."
"The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, and they have the presence of Italians who participate in international competitions and Olympic events."
"Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), which makes this country the 7th largest island in the world."
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, we often refer to it, in geographic terms, as an "archipelago".
"The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by coined the name "Ilha Formosa" or beautiful island for the island."
"In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeast Taiwan, where they began transforming the practices of indigenous grain production and relied on Chinese workers for rice and sugar plantations."
"In the year 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of the west and north of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885."
"In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945."
"Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows."
"The majority of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared."
"In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration work continues to this day."
"For example, the most common frame format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size at the end of the analog film era."
"It still occurs today, but even more importantly: its aspect ratio has been inherited in the formats of digital image camera sensors."
"The 35 mm format actually creates a bit of confusion, with 36 mm width and 24 mm height."
It is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
"Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are the same or very similar to this aspect ratio."
"The rule of thirds, which has been overused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image."
"It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection between the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example)."
"During this period, European history questioned the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful."
"For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states despite differences in language and customs."
"His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners."
"One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the monetary funds of the church exist precisely for this reason."
"The main authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder if this dogma was being fulfilled."
"Shortly after the start of hostilities, Brittany began a naval blockade of Germany."
"The strategy proved to be effective, cutting off vital supplies to both military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international laws that had been codified by various international agreements in the last two centuries."
"Brittany mined the international waters to prevent any ships from entering complete segments of the ocean, even putting neutral ships at risk."
"As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare."
"During the 1920s, the prevalent attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation."
"After having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future."
"In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York."
"He arrived in the United States with four hundred dollars in his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his last job) for Thomas Edison."
"Ancient China had a unique way of displaying different historical periods: each stage of China or each family in power was a different dynasty."
Also, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
"In these periods, fierce wars took place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne."
"The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods of ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an."
"There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler."
"Similarly, after the Revolution, occupations were opened to all men who requested it, allowing the most ambitious and successful ones to achieve it."
"This also applies to the military, because instead of basing the ranks of the army on classes, from this moment on they were based on relevance."
"The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the repressed working class of other countries to start their own revolutions."
"Mohammed was deeply interested in matters that go beyond this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that would become known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation."
"The very cave, which has survived the passage of time, gives a quite clear image of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad."
"At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world."
"In fact, even knowing of its existence, it is not easy to find at all. The isolation is absolute once you arrive inside the cave."
"Nothing can be seen except for a clear and beautiful sky above the head, and the abundant mountains that surround it. There is very little of this world that can be seen or heard from inside the cave."
"The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands."
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many great pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, various temples, and the Great Sphinx.
"The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of the pharaoh's wives and family members."
The signal "upward arc" looks like the letter V (lowercase) and the "downward arc" looks like a staple or a square without the bottom side.
"When it appears upwards it means that you have to start from the tip and push the bow in an upward direction, and when it is downwards it means that you have to start from the heel (which is where the hand holds the bow) and stretch the bow in a downward direction."
"Rubbing the strings from right to left generates a smoother sound, while doing it the other way around produces a louder and more assertive sound."
"Feel free to take note of your own indications, but keep in mind that the musical markings are there for a reason, so they should be respected."
"The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Maria Teresa and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabet, were forced by a crowd of merchant women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789."
"In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and muttered threats against the King and Queen."
"The crowd forced the king and queen to have the windows of the carriage completely open."
"At a certain point, a member of the crowd showed the head of a royal guard murdered in Versailles in front of the horrified Queen."
"The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves."
"They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime, in order to finance a good part of the expenses and interests of the bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street."
"Of course, the great profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of United States imperialism."
"In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that promoted the creation of the order."
"The period in which the events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300 AD)."
"The High Middle Ages preceded the Full Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around the year 1500."
"Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological drive or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is guided by a hidden logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology."
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that motor vehicles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a road network throughout the country for a handful of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The possession of cars in mass also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new medical assistance techniques to repair damaged bodies.
"Romanticism had an important component of cultural determinism, drawn by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."
"In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography emerged that were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, as they were in harmony with the place and society."
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
"His reputation for being a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD."
"His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Croats had returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices that had more value than those offered in the Byzantine markets."
"It was at this moment when the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris."
"The Gothic style reached its maximum popularity during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century."
"Initially, the clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East."
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, styles could reach the West with a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the time is that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
"Subsistence agriculture is the one carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family."
"Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses native seeds from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield."
"Historically, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing nations."
"Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas who feel abandoned by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity."
"Subcultures can differ due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members."
"The qualities that determine a subculture as different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors."
"The members of a subculture often distinguish themselves from those of other subcultures by the distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashion, customs, and slang."
"One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up, due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse."
These children are called "wild" or feral. Some wild children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical deficiency by the parents.
"The feral children may have suffered from child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away."
"Others are supposedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild all alone."
"The wild child, when raised only by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (always within physical limits) almost identical to those of the animal that raises it, such as fear or indifference towards humans."
"Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the construction goes one step further."
"The scaffolding theory is not a learning method, but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals who undergo a new learning experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a project."
"Bastides" can be virtual or real: in other words, a teacher is a form of "bastida," but so is the small assistant clip in Microsoft Office."
"Virtual tutorials are integrated into the software and are designed to question, display, and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to figure out on their own."
"Children are placed in foster care for different reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, including extortion."
"No child should grow up in an environment where they are not fed, loved, and educated, but there are some who do."
"We believe that the foster care system is a form of security for these children."
"Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare."
"It is supposed that the reception provides all the needs that were not covered in the original house from where they were taken."
"Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication."
"The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications."
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the public's reaction to websites."
"The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds."
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
"Oliver Sacks, in his article "The King's Speech," indicated how people who are not able to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately evaluate sincerity."
It even suggests that these abilities to interpret human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
"In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed."
"The mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection eliminates it from the set of variation heritage that is expressed."
"Segregation and recombination combine the forward and backward variation between the two genetic heritages in each generation."
"On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet their amino acid needs with the available plant resources."
Furthermore, not achieving it has serious consequences: growth decline, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
"The easiest plant resources to obtain would have been the proteins provided by leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, these are difficult to digest for primates like us humans."
On the other hand, animal-origin foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also provide a large amount of protein that contains all essential amino acids.
However, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" just as the savannah chimpanzees do today.
"The interruption of sleep is the process of deliberately waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a while (10 - 60 minutes)."
"This is easy to do using a quiet alarm clock that will make you aware but not fully wake you up."
"If you are one of those who resets the clock while sleeping, try putting it on the other side of the room so that you have to get up to turn it off."
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking a lot of liquids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to bed, so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
"The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in their body and spirit."
"The lower the tension, the more positive the present vital force is. Each person has the potential to find peace and complete satisfaction."
"Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way on this path is our own tension and negativity."
"Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were spread through the path of Mahayana love and through many techniques of Indian yoga."
"In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love."
"With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations."
"The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created."
"Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which facilitated collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice came the clash of systems, processes, and cultures, and both countries became enemies."
"Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."
"It lasted for the following forty years and there was a real fight, with delegated armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places."
"On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been penetrated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead."
However, these plans became obsolete during the night, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral or multilateral treaties.
"Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient method of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."
The job of marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
"One of the most relevant recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain."
"Contemporarily, the German navy, mainly using submarines, attempted to stop this traffic."
"If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany could have conquered Great Britain, just as it did with the rest of Europe."
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
"Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to easily have milk, fur, meat, and skin."
Domestic goats used to be kept in herds that grazed on hills or other grazing areas, often watched over by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
"The carriages were built in England already towards the 16th century."
"Although the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they were pulled by horse-drawn wagons to achieve higher speeds and to pull larger loads in the most difficult parts."
"The sleepers were introduced quite soon to keep the rails in place. However, it was soon seen that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron cover on top."
"This became a common practice, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the wagons more."
"In the end, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first completely iron rails were introduced in 1767."
"The first known means of transportation was walking, humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man)."
"Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright."
"Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs up to 7 million years ago."
"We can start living in a more environmentally respectful way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce the suffering that could exist in the future."
"This only works as a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them."
"It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that problems have increased due to the excess of population and the extravagant lifestyle of humans."
"After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press located a few streets away."
"During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap flyers"."
"The first public reading of the document was carried out by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th."
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which he had read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
"The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original handwritten copy has not survived."
"Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. We call them birds."
"Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."
"But there are many bird traits that resemble those of a dinosaur."
"They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus."
"Practically all the computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers."
"A binary number can only have one of two possible values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, according to computer jargon."
"Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite general, so an immediate diagnosis cannot be made."
"The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals."
"Look for instructions on specific first aid for the specific poison on the label."
"The term insect is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects."
"This term derives from the ancient relationship with bedbugs, which are highly adapted insects that parasitize humans."
"Both reduviids and bed bugs are nest-dwelling, adapted to seeing in the nest or habitat of their host."
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
"EM is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve."
"The research has concluded that women have twice (2 times more) the likelihood of suffering from multiple sclerosis than men."
"A couple can decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child."
"These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby."
"In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child."
"The main objective of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research."
However, experimentation is not the only way, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
"The naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin."
"Aristotle's opinions on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted."
"Just as the knowledge of the Greeks diminished, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots."
"Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks."
"Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living beings, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals."
"Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals."
"The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material."
"Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."
"They carried out two experiments marking the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive sulfur."
"Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ line cells."
"Only mutations in the germ cells can be transmitted to offspring, whereas mutations in any other location can cause cell death or cancer."
"Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the wildlife of plants and animals."
"Among the examples of on-site activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information."
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
"Every morning, people leave the small rural villages by car to go to their workplace and pass by others whose workplace is the place they just left."
In this dynamic vehicle, everyone, in some way, is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
"Science shows us today that this colossal coal economy has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years."
"Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems."
"In developed countries, you will rarely hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges."
"Why do transportation systems generate this kind of complaints, why do they fail daily? Is it that transport engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?"
"The Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions established between them."
"Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with 100% certainty."
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a considerably constant range; therefore, traffic flow tends to have a considerable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
"To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) velocity."
"These relationships help with the planning, design, and operations of road facilities."
"Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently."
"Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their body."
"This provides them with a great variety of small places where they can hide from predators."
"Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the stoneflies and the mayflies."
"Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun."
There were people who thought that what he said was true, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
"That seems reasonable, because we don't have the sensation that the Earth is moving, do we?"
"The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river."
"The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width."
"20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon."
"The main Amazon river is 6,387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers."
"Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed."
"To the ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period, the monuments of their predecessors fascinated them, which at that time were already over a thousand years old."
"The population of the Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population."
"The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications."
"Italian is also the daily language used by the majority of people who live in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies."
"All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics."
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
"Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire."
"It resembled more the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although in addition, according to their theory, they changed to become new substances that form what we see."
"Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table has many elements."
"The elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also other metals such as silver and gold."
One can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
"All the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms."
"The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of atoms could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence."
"In this way, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it was invented."
"Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a minor status and usage."
"At present, people write messages on computer screens without ever needing a pencil sharpener."
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer emerges.
"The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to join a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."
"Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Separating the core from the nut releases some of this energy."
"Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with a small or zero collision."
"The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust."
"The crust measures 70 km thick at its closest part and 100 km at its farthest part."
"It is thinner under lunar seas and thicker under mountainous areas."
"There may be more lunar seas on the visible face because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to come to the surface."
"Theories of content focus on finding what people like or are interested in."
"These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized so that they mature into adulthood."
These theories look at what makes certain people want to do the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
"Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory."
In general, two behaviors can appear when administrators begin to lead their former colleagues. One extreme of the spectrum is to try to continue as "just one of the guys" (or girls).
"This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary actions, carrying out evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable for their actions."
"In the opposite case, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that they have to change everything that the team has been doing and make it their own."
"After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team."
This behavior often ends up in quarrels between the leaders and the rest of the team.
"Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but with some small differences."
"The members of a virtual group usually serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group."
"They usually have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, since their teams can meet according to different time zones that the local management may not understand."
"The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."
"The 'invisible team' is the administrative team that each member addresses. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One of the objectives for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
"Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization."
Therefore, the joint work of an organization to overcome adversity can lead to an innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
"For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning."
"Angel (2006) explains the continuous improvement approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance."
"Neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows down the research area and makes it much more precise."
"The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports the research of scientists."
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
"The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before."
"This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind."
Although AI has strong science-fiction connotations, it forms a very important branch of computer science that studies the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
"The research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."
Examples of these are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
"These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems."
"The AI system is now frequently used in fields such as economy, medicine, engineering, and military, as it has been built into various domestic computer applications and video games."
"Thematic outings are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would love to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option."
"Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or contemplate the beauty of art while sitting with their class."
"Sharing a virtual trip is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future students."
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital. Every year the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online as a memory book.
"Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the existence of an audience."
"As students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to make an effort to improve their writing to avoid criticism."
In addition, blogs "force students to be more savvy about the world around them". The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and curious (Toto, 2004).
"Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day."
"The appropriate use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical; they can define their positions in the context of what others write and also highlight their own perspectives on specific topics by actively responding to internet materials (Oravec, 2002)."
"Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present."
"To the south there are the Niagara Falls and to the north lies the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond."
"All these elements, among others, are what make Ontario stand out in the eyes of foreigners as the quintessential Canadian city."
"The population of the vast northern regions is rather scarce, and some areas are almost uninhabited wild lands."
"To make a population comparison that is usually surprising: there are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens."
"The Islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa."
"Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife."
"Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts."
"The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and embarked on a great journey to the Comoros and Mayotte."
"The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route from Europe to India around the Cape."
"To the north, the region borders with the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean."
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler say that she is married, regardless of her true marital status.
"It is also useful to wear a ring (one that doesn't look too expensive)."
Women should realize that cultural differences can cause what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
"Reject men firmly, and don't be afraid to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, it's not okay!)."
"The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazigh fishermen in the 10th century BC, and Phoenicians, Romans, and Benimerines used it as a strategic port, which was called Anfa."
"The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755."
"The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city with the name of Daru l-Badya, the name Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there."
"Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in Morocco."
"In the surroundings of the old Medina we can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it's all intended for tourists."
"Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, towards the eastern end, near Rwanda."
"In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets in the city, especially in the center."
"Although Goma is considerably safe, it would be advisable to investigate before making any visits outside of this city to evaluate the state of the ongoing conflicts in the province of North Kivu."
"The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most affordable mountain gorilla tracking in Africa."
"You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to move around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip."
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has ended up being used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands."
"Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport."
"In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands."
"It was one of the main stops during the special program "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates for PBS."
"The city is in strong contrast with the rest of the cities in the country because it has a more Arab air than African."
"The Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, and Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the southern border."
"The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting diverse wildlife."
"It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the benchmark of South African national parks (SANParks)."
"As with all South African national parks, a daily conservation and entrance fee must be paid."
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of South Africa.
"The Island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main center."
"The set of buildings that make up the urban silhouette of Hong Kong has been associated with a bright bar graph that becomes evident with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour."
"To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the other side of the Kowloon waterfront."
"The vast majority of urban development in Hong Kong Island is densely populated on land reclaimed from the sea along the north coast."
"This is the place that British colonizers occupied, therefore, it is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past."
"The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India."
"The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans as a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park."
"The forests are not only mangrove swamps, but also include some of the last remaining stops of the powerful jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain."
"The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which around one-third is covered by water/swampy areas."
"Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area."
"The buses depart from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30."
"As buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance."
"Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and sturdy."
"Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200)."

"The two towers have a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters and have two lanes of 3.50 meters width."
"The open vertical space under the bridge is 15 meters. Although the construction was completed in August 2011, it was not possible to transit through it until March 2017."
"It is expected that the bridge will be fully functional in September 2017, when it is expected that the customs of Brazil will be completed."
"The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture."
"The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing."
Paraguay, previously known as "The Giant Province of the Indies", was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and groups of native indigenous people.
"The Spaniards began the period of colonization that lasted for three centuries."
"Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a large part of its indigenous character and identity."
"Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world."
"The most important annual tournament of this sport takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas."

"For news about tournaments or where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association."
"The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), with a fixed value equivalent to that of a British pound (GBP)."
"The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store."
"Generally, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted in Stanley."
"In peripheral islands, credit cards probably won't be accepted, although they may accept British and American currency; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is accepted."
"It is almost impossible to exchange currency from the Falkland Islands outside of the islands, so it must be done before leaving."
"As Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa."
"Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. During the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common."
"Winter can be falsely cold: temperatures rarely reach levels below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make the sensation colder than what the thermometer indicates."
"There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is more or less constant throughout the year."
"Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed."
"According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from the rest of the wild animals!"
"However docile they may seem, bison, elk, ants, bears, and almost all large animals can attack."
"Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not leaving a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space."
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bones and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking fragrant foods and keep the camping area clean.
"Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants."

During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
"The beaches are abundant, as Auckland is situated between two ports. The most popular ones are located in three areas."
"The beaches of North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south."
"Most of them are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most of them have shade thanks to the pohutukawa trees."
"The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland."
"These are sometimes family beaches full of a good range of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe."
"The most well-known local beer is the "Number One"; it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta"."
